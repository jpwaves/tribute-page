            <p>Mako had many achievements in his life, so here is a summary of his greatest achievements, as well as a timeline of parts of Mako's life. This tribute will also be biased towards including more <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> content because I'm a big ATLA fan and love the character Mako played in the show, Uncle Iroh ðŸ˜Š.</p>
